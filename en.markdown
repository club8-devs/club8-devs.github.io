# About the token

`$ANON` is a token launched by a closed community of owners of anonymous Telegram numbers 8 Club.

The main value of the token is its support by a powerful community with a rather high entry threshold, because numbers are in high price nowadays.

There are more than 2500 people in the club, most of whom are old TON-adepts, and among them you can meet both developers and creators of the largest projects of the whole ecosystem - GameFi applications, DEX-exchanges, various protocols and utility applications, and professional traders, investors and NFT-collectors.

The main task of the token is to introduce the crypto world to anonymous numbers and demonstrate all the innovative opportunities offered by the fastest blockchain in the world - TON.

Token `$ANON` is the best way of promotion and in just a few hours of closed presale, launched by one of the active members of our community, more than 500.000$ was raised. And that's just the beginning, isn't it?
